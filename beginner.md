Basics: wWbBeE

	b - Backward to the next beginning of a word
	B - Backward to the next beginning of a WORD

Slightly less basic: fFtT
All follow [(n)um]<verb><n(o)un> syntax

	[n]f<o> - Forward until (nth) (o)  (Inclusive)
	[n]F<o> - Backward until (nth) (o) (Inclusive)
	[n]t<o> - Forward until (nth) (o)  (Exclusive)

	abcdefg, abcdefg, abcdefg

Searching

	/  - Forward
	?  - Backward
	*  - Word under cursor - forward  (bounded)
	g* - Word under cursor - forward  (unbounded)
	#  - Word under cursor - backward (bounded)
	g# - Word under cursor - backward (unbounded)
	n  - Next result, forward
